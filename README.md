Java Sass static compiler
=========================

This project is based on the webapp example provided by [bit3-jsass](https://github.com/bit3/jsass)

It consists of a single java class, **JsassRuntime**, that can be used to statically compile a sass source.

You need to edit the *path* variable inside this class according to your UX project, before compiling.

The original webapp files were kept unchanged, but they are no longer necessary.

I used [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) to import this project 
and run the main class, **JsassRuntime**, using the shortcut *Ctrl+Shift+F10*.
